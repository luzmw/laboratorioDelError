# laboratorioDelError
“Laboratory of Error” A written and visual exploration of the boundaries between artificial intelligence, creativity, and technological disobedience — as a poetic and political gesture. It contains the manifesto, reflective text, and visual resources of the project. Enter at your own risk. The system might fail  beautifully.
